            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Geethu Krishna, a passionate and dedicated MSc Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Cochin University. With a strong academic foundation in Physics and expertise in AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science, I strive to build innovative solutions that drive real-world impact.

I have hands-on experience in developing chatbots, implementing ML models, and working on projects like crime pattern analysis, sentiment analysis, and generative models for image and audio synthesis. My recent focus has been on predictive analytics and leveraging tools like IBM WatsonX for advanced problem-solving.

I’m deeply inspired by the potential of AI to transform industries and solve complex challenges. My career goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research and development in AI, particularly in creating solutions that enhance human safety and efficiency.

When I’m not immersed in tech, I enjoy volunteering, leading initiatives, and exploring creative ways to make a positive impact. I believe in lifelong learning and am eager to embrace opportunities that push me to grow both personally and professionally.</p>

                <li><strong>Crime Pattern Analysis:</strong> Crime Pattern Analysis Project
                    Objective:
                    This project aimed to analyze and predict crime patterns using machine learning techniques. The focus was on leveraging data to identify trends and provide actionable insights.
                    
                    Key Features:
                    Data Analysis:
                    
                    Collected and analyzed crime data to identify trends and patterns based on various factors such as location, time, and crime type.
                    Used clustering techniques (like K-means) to group areas with similar crime rates or types.
                    Machine Learning Models:
                    
                    Applied classification algorithms (e.g., regression, random forest) to predict crime categories based on historical data.
                    Used deep learning models (e.g., CNN, RNN, DNN) for more complex predictions, such as identifying high-risk zones.
                    Integration of IoT:
                    
                    Incorporated a location sensor and IoT devices to provide real-time crime data for analysis and predictions.
                    Designed a mobile API for easy access to predictions and insights.
                    Technologies Used:
                    Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for model development.
                    IoT sensors for real-time location data.
                    Mobile API for connecting users with predictive models.
                    Outcome:
                    This project provided an efficient way to predict and analyze crime rates, offering actionable insights for law enforcement and public safety agencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney Stone Prediction:</strong> Kidney Stone Prediction Project
                    Objective:
                    To create an AI-driven model that predicts the likelihood of kidney stones in patients.
                    
                    Key Features:
                    Used IBM WatsonX for developing predictive models.
                    Incorporated user data such as symptoms, health history, and medical test results.
